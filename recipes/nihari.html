    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Nihari is a traditional South Asian dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent,
      particularly in the region of Delhi. It is a stew made from slow-cooked beef
      or lamb, and is typically seasoned with a mixture of
      spices such as coriander, cumin, garam masala, ginger, and garlic.
      The meat is cooked until it is tender and falls off the bone, and the sauce is thick and flavorful.

      lemon juice, and julienned ginger. The dish is a staple in the cuisine of the
