    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This method uses the traditional yakhni method of making Pilau.
    Yakhni literally means broth or soup in Urdu. In this method, we cook up a beautiful broth using the chicken,
    all the whole spices, garlic and onions. We will reserve this broth for later – we go on to frying onions
    in glorious ghee until they are golden,
    before adding in the chicken from the broth until the chicken becomes golden too.</p>
    <p>Then we go on to adding the broth, and then the basmati rice and cooking until done.
      This leaves us with a deeply aromatic and flavourful rice dish which will
      likely become a family favourite.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>300 g Rice</li>
        <li>50 ml Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Onions</li>
        <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp Ginger Paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp Garlic Paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp Garam Masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp Crushed Chillies</li>
        <li>1 tsp Peppercorn</li>
        <li>2 Bay Leaf</li>
        <li>2 tsp Cumin Seeds zeera</li>
        <li>2 Green Chillies</li>
        <li>600 ml Water</li>
        <li>750 g Chicken</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl wash the rice then soak for at least 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Whilst the rice is soaking heat the oil in a pan on medium heat until hot</li>
        <li>Add the whole black pepper, cumin seeds and bay leaves then sauté for 1-2 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the finely sliced onions then cook on medium heat for 6-8 minutes until browned</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of water then cook for 1-2 minutes – the colour of the onions at this point will determine the end colour of the rice</li>
        <li>Add the ginger paste, garlic paste, and crushed chillies then sauté for a further 1-2 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes</li>

        <li>Add the water and cook on medium heat for a further 6-8 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the rice and cook for 6-8 minutes on high heat until the majority of the water is absorbed</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on low heat for another 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Serve alongside some homemade raita and enjoy!</li>
